NOREFRESH

	(command) tells Logo not to remember the turtle's motions, which may
	be useful to save time and memory if your program is interactive or
	animated, rather than drawing a static picture you'll want to print
	later (wxWidgets).  In non-wxWidgets versions, using NOREFRESH may
	prevent Logo from restoring the graphics image after the window is
	moved, resized, or overlayed.
