SETTEXTSIZE height

	command (wxWidgets only).  Set the "point size" of the font used in
	the text and edit windows to the given integer input.  The desired
	size may not be available, in which case the nearest available size
	will be used.  Note: There is only a slight correlation between these
	integers and pixel sizes.  Our rough estimate is that the number of
	pixels of height is about 1.5 times the point size, but it varies for
	different fonts.  See SETLABELHEIGHT for a different approach used for
	the graphics window.
