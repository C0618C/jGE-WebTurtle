VBARREDP char
VBARRED? char
BACKSLASHED? char                               (library procedure)

	outputs TRUE if the input character was originally entered into Logo
	within vertical bars (|) to prevent its usual special syntactic
	meaning, FALSE otherwise.  (Outputs TRUE only if the character is a
	backslashed space, tab, newline, or one of ()[]+-*/=<>":;\~?| )

	The names BACKSLASHEDP and BACKSLASHED? are included in the Logo
	library for backward compatibility with the former names of this
	primitive, although it does *not* output TRUE for characters
	originally entered with backslashes.
