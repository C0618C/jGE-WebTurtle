BUTTON

	outputs 0 if no mouse button has been pushed inside the Logo window
	since the last call to BUTTON.  Otherwise, it outputs an integer
	between 1 and 3 indicating which button was most recently pressed.
	Ordinarily 1 means left, 2 means right, and 3 means center, but
	operating systems may reconfigure these.
