SETLABELHEIGHT height

	command (wxWidgets only).  Takes a positive integer argument and tries
	to set the font size so that the character height (including
	descenders) is that many turtle steps.  This will be different from
	the number of screen pixels if SETSCRUNCH has been used.  Also, note
	that SETSCRUNCH changes the font size to try to preserve this height
	in turtle steps.  Note that the query operation corresponding to this
	command is LABELSIZE, not LABELHEIGHT, because it tells you the width
	as well as the height of characters in the current font.
