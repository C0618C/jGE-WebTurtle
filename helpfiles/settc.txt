	command (wxWidgets only).  The inputs are color numbers, or RGB color
	lists, as for turtle graphics.  The foreground and background colors
	for the textscreen/splitscreen text window are changed to the given
	values.  The change affects text already printed as well as future
	text printing; there is only one text color for the entire window.

	command (non-wxWidgets Windows and DOS extended only).  The inputs are
	color numbers, as for turtle graphics.  Future printing to the text
	window will use the specified colors for foreground (the characters
	printed) and background (the space under those characters).  Using
	STANDOUT will revert to the default text window colors.  In the DOS
	extended (ucblogo.exe) version, colors in textscreen mode are limited
	to numbers 0-7, and the coloring applies only to text printed by the
	program, not to the echoing of text typed by the user.  Neither
	limitation applies to the text portion of splitscreen mode, which is
	actually drawn as graphics internally.
