REPCOUNT

	outputs the repetition count of the innermost current REPEAT or
	FOREVER, starting from 1.  If no REPEAT or FOREVER is active,
	outputs -1.

	The abbreviation # can be used for REPCOUNT unless the REPEAT is
	inside the template input to a higher order procedure such as
	FOREACH, in which case # has a different meaning.
