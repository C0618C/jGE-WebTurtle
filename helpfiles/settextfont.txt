SETTEXTFONT fontname

	command (wxWidgets only).  Set the font family used in the text window
	to the one named by the input.  Try 'Courier' or 'Monospace' as likely
	possibilities.  Not all computers have the same fonts installed.  It's
	a good idea to stick with monospace fonts (ones in which all
	characters have the same width).
