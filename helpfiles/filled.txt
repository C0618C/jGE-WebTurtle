FILLED color instructions

	runs the instructions, remembering all points visited by turtle
	motion commands, starting *and ending* with the turtle's initial
	position.  Then draws (ignoring penmode) the resulting polygon,
	in the current pen color, filling the polygon with the given color,
	which can be a color number or an RGB list.  The instruction list
	cannot include another FILLED invocation.
