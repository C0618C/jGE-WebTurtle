	./configure
	make

The executable file in this distribution includes libraries from the
wxWidgets project (www.wxwidgets.org).  The Microsoft Windows version
is distributed with runtime library mingwm10.dll, from the MinGW project
(www.mingw.org).  Those libraries are also covered by the Gnu GPL.  We
do not distribute their source code; you can download it from their
respective web sites.

The Macintosh version uses wxWidgets version 2.6.4, which is not the
latest version, because the latest (2.8.4) as of this release breaks the
ability to floodfill on the Mac.  However, in order to have a font
selection dialog, that part of the 2.8.4 release was retrofitted into
the 2.6.4 release.  For anyone interested in rebuilding UCBLogo on the Mac,
the changes to 2.6.4 are in the file mac-fontmod.tar in this directory.

UCBLogo's source code is maintained as a Sourceforge project; you can
subscribe to the svn archive at
